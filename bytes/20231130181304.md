title: React Router Typed Params
tags: [react, typescript]

The `useParams` and `useSearchParams` hooks from React Router are critical
when working with dynamic routes, however they have some sharp edges when
used with TypeScript. With a small amount of additional code, we can make
it much easier to work with params.

The two primary issues with `useParams` (and `useSearchParams`) are:

1. All params are marked as potentially undefined, even if they are
   required params.
1. All params are returned as strings.

Let's solve these two problems by creating a custom `useStrictParams` hook
which will both mark params as required as well as handle type conversion
for us.

```typescript showLineNumbers
import { useParams, useSearchParams } from "react-router-dom"

type TypeDef = Record<string, NumberConstructor | StringConstructor>

type StrictParams<T> = {
  [K in keyof T]: T[K] extends NumberConstructor
    ? number
    : T[K] extends StringConstructor
    ? string
    : never
}

function toStrict<T extends TypeDef>(
  params: [string, string | undefined][],
  typedef: T,
): StrictParams<T> {
  return params.reduce((acc, [key, value]) => {
    const type = typedef[key]
    return type ? { ...acc, [key]: value ? type(value) : null } : acc
  }, {} as StrictParams<T>)
}

export function useStrictParams<T extends TypeDef>(
  typedef: T,
): StrictParams<T> {
  const params = useParams()
  return toStrict(Object.entries(params), typedef)
}
```

To use this new hook, we can simply call it and provide an object which
specifies the types of our params. We cannot simply use generic types since
the types are not only used to specify the available params, but in the
case of numbers, they also convert the runtime values to the correct types.
While this example only uses strings and numbers, adding support for
booleans or even dates would be very simple.

```typescript
const { userId, age } = useStrictParams({ userId: String, age: Number })
```

We can do the same with search params with the following code:

```typescript showLineNumbers
export function useStrictSearchParams<T extends TypeDef>(
  typedef: T,
): [StrictParams<T>, (params: URLSearchParams) => void] {
  const [searchParams, setSearchParams] = useSearchParams()
  return [toStrict([...searchParams.entries()], typedef), setSearchParams]
}
```

## Future Ideas

This idea could be expanded on to include other features such as converting
arrays of search params via the `Array` type, or even allowing undefined
values by creating a `Maybe` type like this:

```typescript
useStrictParams({ query: Maybe(String) })
```
