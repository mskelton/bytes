title: Fixing Multiline Link Styles
tags: [css]
---

If you've ever created custom link styles to show on hover to replace the rather
dull underline that is the default behavior for links, you may very well have
encountered issues when links begin to wrap across multiple lines. Thankfully,
CSS has a solution to this with a fairly obscure property:
`box-decoration-break`.

The
[`box-decoration-break`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-decoration-break)
property instructs the browser what to do when an element that is broken across
multiple lines (referred to as fragmentation). The default value is `slice`
which basically means the browser renders the element as if it wasn't broken,
then slices it into pieces to wrap across multiple lines. However, if you set
the value to `clone`, each individual fragment will render independently so
properties such as `background-image` will work as you would expect.

Thanks to this property, I was able to fix this problem on my own website where
you are reading this post! Here is what it looked like before:

And then after applying `box-decoration-break: clone`:

The
[MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-decoration-break)
provide a lot more detail and I'd highly recommend giving it a read.
