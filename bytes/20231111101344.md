title: Auto-Delete Old Git Branches
tags: [cli, git]
---

Old Git branches that are already merged can very quickly clutter your local
repository. This can make it more difficult to find active branches you are
working on. With a simple shell script we can clean up these old branches.

```bash showLineNumbers
git checkout "$(basename "$(git symbolic-ref --short refs/remotes/origin/HEAD)")"
git pull
git fetch -p

git branch -vv |
	grep 'origin/.*: gone]' |
	grep -v '^+' |
	awk '{print $1}' |
	xargs git branch -D
```

This script has three main steps:

1. Checkout the default branch (e.g. main or master)
1. Fetch all origin branches pruning the branches no longer present on the
   origin
1. Deletes local branches which were deleted on the origin

I use this command on a daily basis as a replacement for the typical workflow of
checking out the default branch and pulling changes. It's only one script I have
to run, and it keeps my workspace tidy at the same time!
