title: Better Code Search with Flashlight
tags: [cli, javascript]
---

Earlier last year, I created a tool called
[Flashlight](https://github.com/mskelton/flashlight) which is a
Rust-powered JavaScript code search tool. I recently added support for
searching for JSX tags and I'd like to highlight the features of Flashlight
briefly.

In a nutshell, Flashlight allows you to search for various pieces of code
(currently only imports and JSX tags) in a way that traditional editor
search would have difficulty doing. For example, if you want to find all
imports from `react` where `useState` was imported, you could run the
following command.

```bash
flashlight imports react useState
```

You could do this with search in your editor, but when imports span
multiple lines, this get's a bit tougher.

But it's not just imports, you can also search for JSX tags! When using tag
search, you can search by tag, attribute, and value for a very granular
search experience!

```bash
flashlight tags Button
flashlight tags Button variant
flashlight tags Button variant=primary
```

Again, some of these searches would be very difficult to do with
traditional editor search, but because Flashlight is analyzing the code
structure, it is able to very easily answer these types of queries.

To start using Flashlight today, run the installation command in your shell
of choice. Flashlight comes with shell completions for bash, zsh, and fish
so you can hit the ground running!

```bash
curl -LSfs https://mskelton.dev/flashlight/install | sh
```
