title: URL Encode Text In Bash
tags: [bash]
---

In an upcoming Byte I'll be sharing a script that I built which opens pull
request URLs based on Git branch names. However to do this correctly, we
need to URL encode the input data. With the help of
[jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) and 5 lines of code, we can URL encode
any text we need.

```bash /usr/local/bin/url-encode
#!/bin/bash

while IFS= read -r line; do
	echo "$line" | jq -Rr @uri
done
```

To use this, we can call it like so:

```bash
echo "Author: Mark Skelton" | url-encode
```

Which should produce this as the result:

```
Author%3A%20Mark%20Skelton
```
