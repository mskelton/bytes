title: Encrypting Data With Node.js
tags: [node]
---

In a recent side project I came upon the need to securely store credentials
in a database that I can later retrieve and use as part of the application.
I know that Node.js has a very extensive `crypto` module, so I knew it was
possible, though I wasn't sure on the specifics.

Typically when storing passwords or other similar secrets, values are
hashed but in my case I needed to encrypt/decrypt data since I need to
access the original value after accessing it from my database. To make this
work, we can use the `createCipheriv` function along with a secret key and
initialization vector (IV) to encrypt and decrypt our data.

```ts
import crypto from "node:crypto"

const algorithm = "aes-256-cbc"
const secretKey = process.env.SECRET_KEY

if (!secretKey) {
  throw new Error("SECRET_KEY environment variable is required")
}

const key = crypto
  .createHash("sha512")
  .update(secretKey)
  .digest("hex")
  .substring(0, 32)

const iv = crypto.randomBytes(16)

export function encrypt(data: string) {
  const cipher = crypto.createCipheriv(algorithm, Buffer.from(key), iv)
  let encrypted = cipher.update(data, "utf-8", "hex")
  encrypted += cipher.final("hex")

  // Package the IV and encrypted data together so it can be stored in a single
  // column in the database.
  return iv.toString("hex") + encrypted
}

export function decrypt(data: string) {
  // Unpackage the combined iv + encrypted message. Since we are using a fixed
  // size IV, we can hard code the slice length.
  const inputIV = data.slice(0, 32)
  const encrypted = data.slice(32)
  const decipher = crypto.createDecipheriv(
    algorithm,
    Buffer.from(key),
    Buffer.from(inputIV, "hex"),
  )

  let decrypted = decipher.update(encrypted, "hex", "utf-8")
  decrypted += decipher.final("utf-8")
  return decrypted
}
```

The nice thing about this implementation is that it returns a plain
`string` with the IV and encrypted data sandwiched together. As long as you
use the `decrypt` function, it knows how to properly decrypt the value
making it really simple to store in a database.

```ts
const password = "my secret password, don't tell anyone!"
const encrypted = encrypt(password)
const decrypted = decrypt(encrypted)
```

I'll probably also explore re-implementing this same logic using the
[web crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API).
But that's for another day!
