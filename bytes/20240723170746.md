title: Keep Track of Your Tenure
tags: [shell]

I started a new job at [Ramp](https://ramp.com) this week, and I quickly
found out that they value the number of days since the inception of the
company. What started as bit of copy/paste in a slide deck, became a core
part of the company culture. Wanting to join the fun, I wrote a simple
shell script to keep track of how long I've been at Ramp.

```bash /usr/local/bin/days
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Total number of days since I started my job

company=Ramp
start="2024-07-22"
company_start="2019-03-18"

diff() {
	today=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
	today_seconds=$(date -j -f "%Y-%m-%d" "$today" "+%s")
	start_seconds=$(date -j -f "%Y-%m-%d" "$1" "+%s")

	# Calculate the number of days
	diff=$(((today_seconds - start_seconds) / 86400))

	echo $((diff))
}

echo "Today is day $(($(diff $start) + 1)) at $company (day $(diff $company_start))"
```

With this in place, I just run `days` in my terminal and viola!

```bash
Today is day 2 at Ramp (day 1954)
```
