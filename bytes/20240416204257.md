title: Type Assertions In Go Are Weird
tags: [go]

I've been using Go a bit more lately for a side project I'm working on and
I ran into a few instances where I needed to do use type assertions for
some fairly flexible interfaces. While I could easily do what I needed to,
it still feels weird.

Here's the first example of a type assertion where we test the `config`
variable to see if it is of type `arg_parser.BulkConfig` and if so, we
check `ok` which we get as part of the tuple result to then use in our
conditional logic. It works, but just feels pretty strange. Really makes me
miss Rust's pattern matching.

```go
if bulk, ok := config.(arg_parser.BulkConfig); ok {
    size = bulk.Size
}
```

And here is a more complex example which really felt weird. Instead of a
concrete type in the type assertion, we can use `type` and then use a
switch statement to match the first valid interface. Again, this totally
works, but it just feels so strange!

```go
switch a := arg.(type) {
case arg_parser.TextArg:
    task.Title = a.Text
case arg_parser.TagArg:
    task.Tags = append(task.Tags, a.Tag)
case arg_parser.ScopedArg:
    if a.Scope == arg_parser.ScopePriority {
        task.Priority = a.Value
    } else {
        printer.Error(fmt.Errorf("Missing value for \"%s:\"", a.Scope))
    }
}
```

This is one of those things in Go that just takes getting used to. So many
parts of Go feel so wrong at first, but then after using it for a while,
you end up realizing that the simplicity of Go is so worth the fact that a
few things feel a little weird at first.
