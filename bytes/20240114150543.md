title: Calculating Stacked Border Radius
tags: [css]

You've likely encountered the common issue of calculating a border radius
value when you have an element with a border radius within a parent element
which also has a border radius. If you use the same value for both, the
inner radius will look wrong.

Instead of using the same value for both the inner and outer radius, you
want to **add** the inner radius and the padding to get the value for the
outer radius. For example, if the inner radius is `8px` and the padding is
`8px`, then the outer radius should be `16px`.
