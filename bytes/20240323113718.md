title: Zoxide, A Smarter cd Command
tags: [cli]
---

I recently started using a tool called
[Zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide) from a friend's
recommendation and I must say, it's pretty awesome. Zoxide is a smarter
`cd` command that tracks your most used directories and allows you to jump
to them with ease.

Installing Zoxide is a simple Brew command:

```bash
brew install zoxide
```

There is some shell setup required and since I use Fish, I had to add the
following to my `~/.config/fish/config.fish` file:

```bash
zoxide init fish | source
```

With that in place, we can now use the `z` command as an alternative to the
`cd` command. The `z` command works exactly like `cd` but with some
additional features. For example, you can use `z -` to jump to the last
directory you were in, or `z data` to jump to the most used directory that
contains the word `data`.

Here are some examples:

```bash
# jumps to ~/dev/data-science
z ~/dev/data-science

# jumps to ~/dev
z -

# jumps to ~/dev/data-science
z data
```

I'd highly recommend checking it out yourself, it's a great tool to have in
your toolbox.
