title: CSS inset Property
tags: [css]

How many times have you set the same value for `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and
`right` to fill an absolutely positioned element to fit it's parent
element? Thankfully there is an easier way!

Next time instead of writing this:

```css
p {
  top: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
}
```

Combine all the properties together using the `inset` shorthand:

```css
p {
  inset: 0;
}
```

docs for more details!
