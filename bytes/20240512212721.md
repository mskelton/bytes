title: Preventing Overflow With sr-only
tags: [css]
---

The `sr-only` class is a common convention for visually hiding an element
while keeping it visible to screen readers. If not implemented properly
though, it can cause some unexpected overflow due to absolute positioning.

To review, the `sr-only` class (`visually-hidden` is another common name)
looks something like this:

```css
.sr-only {
  position: absolute;
  width: 1px;
  height: 1px;
  padding: 0;
  margin: -1px;
  overflow: hidden;
  clip: rect(0, 0, 0, 0);
  white-space: nowrap;
  border-width: 0;
}
```

Using this, let's imagine a scroll container with some cards inside. We
want the container height to cap at `300px`, where the cards inside will
scroll. The cards themselves are quite simple, and we're using our
`sr-only` class to display some hidden text.

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <style>
      .container {
        height: 300px;
        overflow: scroll;
      }

      .card {
        height: 200px;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="card">
        <p class="sr-only">Hidden text</p>
        <p>Visible text</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <p class="sr-only">Hidden text</p>
        <p>Visible text</p>
      </div>

      ...
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

If you run this in the browser, you'll notice an interesting issue. The
body of the document begins to scroll! This doesn't make sense at first
since the cards themselves scroll, but the issue is that our `sr-only`
class is using `position: absolute` which means without a
`position: relative` parent in the scroll container, the elements will be
positioned absolute relative to an item outside (the body in our case), and
thus their space will be calculated outside the scroll container, forcing
it to scroll.

The simple solution here is to add relative to our `card` class, though the
fix for you may be slightly different depending on your use case.

```css {3}
.card {
  height: 200px;
  position: relative;
}
```
