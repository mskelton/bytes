title: Scheduling Tasks With launchd
tags: [productivity]
---

macOS a robust tool for scheduling automated tasks: `launchd`. While quite
different for those used to `cron`, it's a pretty great tool for scheduling
jobs.

The backstory is that I use the command-line task manager
[TaskWarrior](https://taskwarrior.org) for managing my todo items and I recently
setup a sync server to share data between my personal and work computers.
However, TaskWarrior requires manually syncing data by running `task sync`. This
is annoying, so I thought, why not run this automatically?

That's where `launchd` comes in! I created a simple config that will run at 8:30
and 5:30 each day, in addition to running on a 10 minute interval throughout the
day.

```xml dev.mskelton.task-sync.plist
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
  <dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>dev.mskelton.task-sync</string>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
      <string>/opt/homebrew/bin/task</string>
      <string>sync</string>
    </array>
    <key>StartInterval</key>
    <integer>600</integer>
    <key>StartCalendarInterval</key>
    <array>
      <dict>
        <key>Hour</key>
        <integer>8</integer>
        <key>Minute</key>
        <integer>30</integer>
      </dict>
      <dict>
        <key>Hour</key>
        <integer>17</integer>
        <key>Minute</key>
        <integer>30</integer>
      </dict>
    </array>
  </dict>
</plist>
```

Drop this file in `~/Library/LaunchAgents/` and running the following command to
start the schedule.

```bash
launchctl bootstrap "gui/$(id -u)" ~/Library/LaunchAgents/dev.mskelton.task-sync.plist
```

If you make edits to the config, run the following to reload the config.

```bash
path=~/Library/LaunchAgents/dev.mskelton.task-sync.plist
launchctl bootout "gui/$(id -u)" $path
launchctl bootstrap "gui/$(id -u)" $path
```

Now sit back and enjoy the beauty of macOS doing work for you! I was very
pleasantly surprised with how well this worked, haven't had to manually sync my
tasks at all since adding this.
