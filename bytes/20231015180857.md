title: Quickly copy the latest commit URL

From time to time, it's helpful to send a coworker the GitHub commit URL for the
latest commit in a repository. While you can navigate to GitHub, find the commit
links, and manually copy it, using a custom CLI command makes this super easy!

The script to copy the commit URL is pretty simple, but it handles all the
complexity of parsing the remote URL into a proper URL.

```bash /usr/local/bin/commit-url
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Default to the latest commit if no commit was provided
commit=${1:-$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)}

# Read the repo base URL from the git config
url=$(git config --get remote.origin.url)

# Take the git@hostname.com:account/repo.git format and turn it into
# https://hostname.com/account/repo/commit/...
if [[ $url != "https://"* ]]; then
	url=$(echo "$url" | sed 's/\.git$//' | sed 's/:/\//' | sed 's/^git@/https:\/\//')
fi

echo "$url/commit/$commit"
```

Now we can print the commit URL in our terminal by running the following
command:

```bash
commit-url
```

The script is nice enough to support passing a commit URL, which is useful to
get the full GitHub URL for a given commit hash.

```bash
commit-url 0dbad3ee
```

## Bonus Tip!

The base `commit-url` command will print the commit URL, which makes the command
very robust allowing us to pipe the output into other commands or including it
in a larger shell script. But often we just want to copy the URL to our
clipboard.

Like many of my other bash commands, I solve this by adding a similarly named
script that will copy the result of the command to the clipboard automatically.

```bash /usr/local/bin/commit-url!
#!/usr/bin/env bash

commit-url "$1" | pbcopy
```

Now we can simply add an exclamation point when running the command and we'll
copy it to the clipboard instead of printing it. Neat, right!?

```bash
commit-url!
```
