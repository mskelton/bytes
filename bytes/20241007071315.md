title: Finding A Function With ast-grep
tags: [bash, ast]
---

[ast-grep](https://ast-grep.github.io/) is a brilliant tool for code search
and transformation that I've written about
[in a previous byte](https://mskelton.dev/bytes/20240904123502). Finding
function calls with specific arguments is an area where ast-grep shines and
makes it much easier to understand usage of a specific function invocation
throughout your codebase.

A recent example from work was finding all instances where we were calling
the function `showToast` where it contained one or more `actions`. Since
the `actions` property could be at the start, middle, or end of the options
object, we might think to write a pattern like this:

```bash
sg run -p 'showToast({ $$$, actions: [$$$], $$$ })'
```

However, the default strictness setting of ast-grep does not match all
cases since it is expecting a property following the `actions` property and
will not match calls like this:
`showToast({ message: '...', actions: [] })`. To resolve this issue we can
set the `strictness` to `ast` which will correctly match all the variations
of this function call:

```bash
sg run --strictness ast -p 'showToast({ $$$, actions: [$$$], $$$ })'
```
