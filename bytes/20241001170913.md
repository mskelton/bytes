title: Show Default Git Branch
tags: [git]
---

In the world of differently named default Git branches (e.g., master, main,
trunk, etc.), writing commands that reference the default branch and work
everywhere is a pain. Thankfully, we can solve this with a single Git
alias.

```toml ~/.gitconfig
[alias]
  default = !basename $(git symbolic-ref --short refs/remotes/origin/HEAD)
```

Now, just run `git default` and it will print the default branch name!
