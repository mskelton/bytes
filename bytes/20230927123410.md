title: Managing Focus With Hammerspoon
tags: [automation]
---

[Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org) is a fantastic tool for
automating common tasks such as window management, hotkeys, and much more.
It uses Lua to allow you to interface with many low-level macOS APIs.
Recently I improved my config to manage Focus (do not disturb).

A recent use case I had for Hammerspoon was to manage Focus when starting
and ending Zoom meetings where I want it to automatically start when the
meeting starts, then automatically turn off when the meeting ends. With
Hammerspoon's capabilities to subscribe to window changes, it only requires
a few lines of Lua code in your Hammerspoon config to make this happen.

```lua showLineNumbers
local function focus(state)
	return function()
        hs.execute("shortcuts run 'Focus' <<<'" .. state .. "'")
	end
end

hs.window.filter
	.new(function(window)
		return window ~= nil and window:title() == "Zoom Meeting"
	end)
	:subscribe(hs.window.filter.windowCreated, focus("on"))
	:subscribe(hs.window.filter.windowTitleChanged, focus("on"))
	:subscribe(hs.window.filter.windowDestroyed, focus("off"))
```

The only unfortunate part of this, is that you do have to create a shortcut
in the Shortcuts app that will actually enable/disable focus mode, since
Apple removed the APIs that once made that possible in Swift or via the
terminal. If you are interested in using this technique yourself, feel free
to install

for this purpose.
