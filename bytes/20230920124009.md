title: GBrowse on main branch
tags: [vim]
---

The `:GBrowse` command from
[vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) is a great way to open a
file or range in the configured upstream provider (e.g. GitHub). However, it's
usually a pain since it opens in the current branch, which is often not pushed.

Thankfully, there is a simple solution to this problem using the following
command:

```vim
:GBrowse main:%
```

This will open the current file on the `main` branch instead of the current
branch. You can also do this with a range.

```vim
:.,.+4GBrowse main:%
```
