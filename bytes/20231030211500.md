title: Transition Shorthand Woes
tags: [css]
---

The [`transition`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)
and [`animation`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation)
shorthand properties are great to reduce the verbosity when declaring several
CSS properties at the same time. However, the combination of both enforced and
unenforced order for certain properties make these properties a bit challenging.

In general, these two CSS properties are very lenient and allow us to specify
the shorthand values in any order, which is great since we don't have to
memorize a very specific order. For example, these two lines are functionally
identical:

```css showLineNumbers
p {
  transition: linear 150ms ease;
  transition: 150ms ease linear;
}
```

Because the set of allowed values for each property are mutually exclusive, then
the order doesn't matter, since the CSS parser can determine from the data type
of each value what property it should be assigned to. However, this falls apart
when we add a delay, which makes these two declarations different:

```css showLineNumbers
p {
  transition: linear 150ms ease 200ms;
  transition: 200ms ease linear 150ms;
}
```

Because the `transition-duration` and `transition-delay` properties both accept
a time value, the `transition` shorthand no longer can infer the desired
property simply from the value's data type, instead the order of the properties
matters with the first time value assigned to `transition-duration` and the
second time value assigned to `transition-delay`.

Because this can be difficult to remember, I appreciate
[Josh Comeau's](https://www.joshwcomeau.com) advice to always specify
`transition-delay` separately so it's always clear what is what:

```css showLineNumbers
p {
  transition: linear 150ms ease;
  transition-delay: 200ms;
}
```

While more verbose, you future self will thank you!
