title: Tailwind Joined Buttons

Something that came up at work recently was joining buttons into a group.
When joined, we wanted the buttons to have no border radius between them to
achieve a nice visual aesthetic.

While we could override the classes for the first and last buttons in the
group, a much simpler and elegant solution is building a simple `Join`
component that handles the border radius for us.

```tsx ./Join.tsx {10}
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge"

export function Join({
  className,
  ...props
}: React.HTMLAtributes<HTMLDivElement>) {
  return (
    <div
      className={twMerge(
        "flex [&>:not(:first-child)]:rounded-l-none [&>:not(:last-child)]:rounded-r-none gap-px",
        className,
      )}
      {...props}
    />
  )
}
```

Most of this snippet is just boilerplate, but the class name is what does
the work. The resulting CSS looks something like this:

```css
.flex > :not(:first-child) {
  border-top-left-radius: 0;
  border-bottom-left-radius: 0;
}

.flex > :not(:last-child) {
  border-top-right-radius: 0;
  border-bottom-right-radius: 0;
}
```

Now, we can use the `Join` component to join buttons together:

```tsx
import { Join } from "./Join"

export function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Join>
      <Button>Save</Button>
      <Button>
        <Icon name="more" />
      </Button>
    </Join>
  )
}
```

With this code, the result looks something like this:
