title: Improving The Commit URL CLI Command
tags: []
---

I previously wrote a Byte about the
[`commit-url`](https://mskelton.dev/bytes/20231015180857) command that I
created and use frequently to copy the GitHub commit URL of the current
commit. The main body of that command was determining the remote URL which
can now be simplified given the new
[`remote-url`](https://mskelton.dev/bytes/20240814075601) command I wrote
about yesterday.

The command is so simple now, it's actually a one liner!

```bash
echo "$(remote-url)/commit/${1:-$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)}"
```
