title: Switch Git Branches With fzf
tags: [cli, git]
---

I frequently switch between Git branches inside of Neovim using Telescope, but
it's also handy to be able to switch branches using fuzzy find when outside of
Neovim.

So, a few lines of Bash later and I'm able to pass a list of Git branches
through [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) and then switch to the branch
that was selected. It will sort by latest commit so that recent branches are at
the top and only local branches will be listed.

```bash showLineNumbers fn
#!/usr/bin/env bash

branches=$(git for-each-ref --sort=-committerdate --format="%(refname:short)" refs/heads/)
current=$(git symbolic-ref --short HEAD)
branch=$(echo "$branches" | grep -v "^$current$" | fzf +m)

if [[ -n "$branch" ]]; then
	git co "$branch"
fi
```
