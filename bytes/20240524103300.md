title: Changing Opacity of Hex Colors Using Relative Colors
tags: [css]
---

CSS has a relative new feature for building relative colors based on a
source color. This allows you to make small changes to a color value
without fully redefining it. One interesting use case for this syntax is
changing the opacity of hex colors.

Let's say we have a color `#0ea5e9` (Tailwind's sky-500), that we want to
darken by 50%. We can do this using relative color syntax and the `rgb`
function.

```css
.card {
  background: rgb(from #0ea5e9 r g b / 50%);
}
```

The `r g b` portion copies the hex code into it's RGB components since we
aren't changing the color itself. Then we simply add the `/ 50%` opacity
specifier and viola, we've changed the opacity of our hex color!

This also works with CSS variables, so if we have our hex code defined as a
variable that we can't modify, no problem!

```css
.card {
  --sky-500: #0ea5e9;
  background: rgb(from var(--sky-500) r g b / 50%);
}
```
