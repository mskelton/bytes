title: Complex Keymap Management In Neovim
tags: [neovim]
---

Neovim's `vim.keymap.set` and similar utilities are very useful for
creating and managing keymaps, however they lack some ergonomics when
building more complex keymaps that require setting and deleting the keymaps
periodically. A simply utility function makes this really clean and easy to
do.

I've called this function `map_fn` (because I honestly couldn't come up
with a better name), and when called it will return a class containing
chainable `set` and `del` methods.

```lua
--- @class Map
--- @field set fun(): Map
--- @field del fun(): Map

--- Creates a keymap function
--- @param mode string|table
--- @param key string
--- @param cmd string|function
--- @param opts_or_desc table|string|nil
--- @return Map
local map_fn = function(mode, key, cmd, opts_or_desc)
	local Map = {}
	Map.__index = Map

	function Map:new()
		local instance = setmetatable({}, self)
		return instance
	end

	function Map:set()
        local opts

        if type(opts_or_desc) == "string" then
            opts = { desc = opts_or_desc, silent = true }
        else
            opts = vim.tbl_extend("keep", opts_or_desc or {}, { silent = true })
        end

		vim.keymap.set(mode, key, cmd, normalize_map_opts(opts_or_desc))
		return self
	end

	function Map:del()
		vim.keymap.del(mode, key)
		return self
	end

	return Map:new():set()
end
```

Combining this with the
[`augroup`](https://mskelton.dev/bytes/20240917222651) function I created
in a previous Byte, we can build a complex mapping and autocmd setup like
this with very little code:

```lua
local command_line = map_fn("n", "q;", "q:", "Open command line window"):set()

augroup("command_line", function(autocmd)
	autocmd("RecordingEnter", { callback = command_line.del })
	autocmd("RecordingLeave", { callback = command_line.set })
end)
```

What this does is create a mapping `q;` which is equivalent to `q:` to open
the command line window. However, because the macro recording stop keymap
is `q`, we only want to enable this mapping when recording is not active,
so our autocmd will handle deleting and re-creating the keymap for us when
the autocmds fire.
