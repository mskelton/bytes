title: Convert PNG to ICO Using ImageMagick
tags: [cli]
---

When making a favicon for a website, it's pretty common to convert a PNG to
an ICO file. There are countless online converters, but they all have
gotchas, rate limits, and it's just hard to find the right one to do the
job for you. With a very simple CLI command, we can do it ourselves!

To start, we need to install [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org). I'm on
macOS, so I'll be using [Brew](https://brew.sh) but this isn't limited to
macOS.

```bash
brew install imagemagik
```

Now we can convert a PNG file to ICO by providing the name of the PNG file
and the output filename of our ICO file.

```bash
magick favicon.png favicon.ico
```

I went ahead and made this into a reusable binary named `pngico` to make it
easier to use.

```bash /usr/local/bin/pngico
#!/usr/bin/env bash

magick "$1" "${1%.*}.ico"
```

To run it, just provide the input filename, and our binary will take care
of the rest.

```bash
pngico favicon.png
```
