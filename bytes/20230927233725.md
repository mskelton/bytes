title: Improving Bolded Font Readability

Using bold to emphasize text is great in certain scenarios, but it can be
difficult to distinguish bold text from normal text, especially in dark mode.

One great way to improve the readability of bold text is to give it a different
color. Yep, it's sometimes that simple! In the case of a dark background, muting
the body text color to a slightly darker white and keeping the bold color a pure
white can really help to make the bold text pop and be very easy to distinguish
at a glance.

I've used this trick on my website for some time now, and as you can **see
here**, it works great!
