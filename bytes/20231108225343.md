title: Quickly Switch Git Branches
tags: [git, cli]

If you find yourself switching branches frequently and getting frustrated with
typing out long branch names, or hitting tab way too many times to get to the
branch you want to switch to, I might just have a solution for you!

This simple bash script will pull a list of your local branches and uses
[`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) to fuzzy-find the branch you want to
checkout. The results are sorted by last commit date, so your most recent
branches are right at the top.

```bash
branches=$(git for-each-ref --sort=-committerdate --format="%(refname:short)" refs/heads/)
current_branch=$(git symbolic-ref --short HEAD)
branch=$(echo "$branches" | grep -v "^$current_branch$" | fzf +m)

if [[ -n "$branch" ]]; then
	git co "$branch"
fi
```
