title: Promisify requestAnimationFrame

If you ever have needed to use the `requestAnimationFrame` API in an async
method where you wait for an animation frame before executing additional
logic, the callback nature of it might get annoying. With a super small
wrapper, you can make a function that returns a promise instead!

```typescript
export function raf(): Promise<DOMHighResTimeStamp> {
  return new Promise<DOMHighResTimeStamp>((resolve) => {
    requestAnimationFrame(resolve)
  })
}
```

Now, just call `await raf()` in your code, and you're good to go!
