I was writing a script the other day that I needed to accept some optional
arguments. I found that I could use the `getopt` command, but turns out the
simple approach was cleaner in the end.

```bash showLineNumbers
#!/usr/bin/env bash

while [[ $# -gt 0 ]]; do
	case "$1" in
    -c | --config)
		config="$2"
		shift 2
		;;
	-u | --url)
		url="$2"
		shift 2
		;;
	*)
		args="$1"
		shift
		;;
	esac
done

echo "$config"
echo "$url"
echo "$args"
```
