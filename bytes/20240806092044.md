title: Video Resizing With ffmpeg
tags: [bash]
---

For a recent work project, I had to downscale a video to a fixed size to
fit into our application as designed. Though I didn't know the exact
options, I new this was a perfect task for my good friend `ffmpeg`

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf "scale=400:600:force_original_aspect_ratio=decrease,pad=400:600:(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2:0xEFEFEF" output.mp4
```

Below is an explanation of each of the options in the above command:

- `scale=400:600` - Scales the video to 400px wide by 600px tall.
- `force_original_aspect_ratio=decrease` - Downscales the video to the
  specified size while maintaining the original aspect ratio.
- `pad=400:600` - Adds padding to the video to achieve the target
  resolution, filling the extra space with a specified color.
  - `(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2` - Centers the video horizontally and vertically.
    `ow` is the output width, `iw` is the input width, etc.
  - `color=0x0000FF` - Specifies the padding color.
