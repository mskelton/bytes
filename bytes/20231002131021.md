title: Arc Browser Shortcuts

If you haven't tried the [Arc browser](https://arc.net/) I highly recommend
giving it a try. It's a fantastic rethinking of how a web browser should work,
with tons of goodies packed inside.

One of my favorite features is the ability to customize keyboard shortcuts for
core browser actions. While some of this is feasible in other browsers using
macOS system preferences to customize menu shortcuts, Arc makes it simpler and
also has a much more powerful shortcut system to allow customizing whether
websites or browsers should win for shortcuts and being able to remove unwanted
shortcuts completely.
