title: Fixing Scrollbar Color in Dark Mode
tags: [css]
---

I've you've ever implemented dark mode on a website, you probably have
experienced that painful moment when you realize that your lovely dark themed
site has an ugly white scrollbar. Thankfully, this is fixed very simply using
`color-scheme`.

The CSS
[`color-scheme`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color-scheme)
property instructs the browser what color schemes are allowed for the given
element which then affects default styling of various elements such as form
controls, scrollbars, and default colors.

While this property can be applied for individual elements, when implementing
dark mode, it's quite common to set this property on the root. Given that it's
an inherited property, it will apply to the entire page when you use this
technique.

```css showLineNumbers
:root {
  color-scheme: dark;
}
```

That's it! Your scrollbars will be properly dark themed along with your site!

> [!INFO What about light mode?]  
> You can set `color-scheme: light` for light mode as well, but browsers will
> render scrollbars and form controls in light mode by default, so you don't
> need to add this property for light mode.
