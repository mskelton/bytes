title: Arc Browser Tab Switcher

In a [previous byte](/bytes/arc-browser-shortcuts), I discussed how the
[Arc browser](https://arc.net) allows a great deal of configuration for keyboard
shortcuts. Another thing that I love about Arc is something you get right out of
the box: the tab switcher.

The tab switcher is much like the macOS `cmd+tab` functionality, but instead of
switching between applications, it allows you to switch between your 5 most
recently accessed tabs. This is much easier than clicking back and forth with
your mouse, and the visual preview of each tab makes it easy to see at a glance
the content of your most recent tabs.

By default, the tab switcher is mapped to `ctrl+tab` and `ctrl+shift+tab` to
navigate forward and backward in the tab switcher. These shortcuts can be
modified in the Arc settings if you don't like the default mappings.

I personally use `cmd+e` and `cmd+shift+e` as I find those to be more ergonomic
than `ctrl+tab`, and `cmd+e` is not a common shortcut I use in the browser.
