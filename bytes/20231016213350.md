When building complex animations, it can sometimes be difficult to fine tune
animations, especially if they complete very quickly. Adjusting the duration
works, but that becomes a pain when you start building multi-phase animations or
when your animation includes several different sets of keyframes.

Thankfully, Chromium-based browsers have an **Animations** panel in DevTools
that allows you to easily slow down all animations on the page to 25% or 10%
making it effortless to slow animations for fine grained testing and tuning. It
also will take screenshots as the animation progresses and show details on
keyframes to give you more insights into your animations.
