title: Fast Searching With ripgrep
tags: cli

I've been using [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) for some time
now, and figured it would be great to share for anyone who hasn't used it
before.

Think of ripgrep like a command-line version of `cmd+shift+f` in your favorite
editor. With it you can search files for regex patterns and get near instant
results thanks to it being written in Rust and heavily optimized.

```bash
rg react
```
