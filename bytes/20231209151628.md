title: Improvements to Typed Router Params
tags: [react, typescript]
---

In a [previous Byte](/bytes/20231130181304), I showed the `useStrictParams` hook
as a way to better manage React router params with better type safety and ease
of use. Since then, I've made some improvements and published it to npm!

You can install the
[`use-strict-params`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/use-strict-params) library
with npm or your favorite package manager.

```bash
npm install use-strict-params
```

A new feature I added since I originally posted was support for optional
properties using the new `Optional` function. This is especially useful for
search params where you still want type conversions but the param is indeed
optional.

```typescript
import { Optional, useStrictSearchParams } from "use-strict-params"

const { page } = useStrictSearchParams({ page: Optional(Number) })
```
