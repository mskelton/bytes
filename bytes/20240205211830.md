title: Animated Expand/Collapse SVG Icon
tags: [css]

I was adding an expand/collapse feature to my website code blocks the other
day, and I wanted to create an animation where the arrows flip vertically
when you press the button.

To accomplish this effect, I used the `transform-origin` and
`transform-box` properties to make the transform centered on the `path`
elements so they would flip properly.

```css
path {
  transform-box: fill-box;
  transform-origin: center;
  transition: transform 15ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);
}
```

Then I simply applied a `rotateX(180deg)` transform to flip the arrows when
the button was clicked.

```css
path.flip {
  transform: rotateX(180deg);
}
```
