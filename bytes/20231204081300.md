title: Creating GIFs Using ffmpeg
tags: [cli]

[ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) is a fantastic tool for converting videos between
various formats. I recently needed to create a GIF from a screen recording,
which you can do with ffmpeg, but the command isn't the easiest to remember.

```bash showLineNumbers /usr/local/bin/gif
#!/bin/bash

ffmpeg -i "$1" \
	-vf "fps=10,scale=1080:-1:flags=lanczos,split[s0][s1];[s0]palettegen[p];[s1][p]paletteuse" \
	-loop 0 "${2:-${i%.*}.gif}"
```

If you're curious what this command does, here's an explanation of each part,
courtesy of ChatGPT.

- `-i "$1"`: Input file is the first command line argument.
- `-vf`: Applies video filters.
  - `fps=10`: Sets the frames per second to 10.
  - `scale=1080:-1`: Scales the video to a width of 1080 pixels; height is set
    automatically to keep aspect ratio.
  - `flags=lanczos`: Uses the Lanczos filter for scaling, known for high
    quality.
  - `split[s0][s1]`: Splits the video stream into two streams, `s0` and `s1`.
  - `[s0]palettegen[p]`: Generates an optimized palette (`p`) for the GIF from
    stream `s0`.
  - `[s1][p]paletteuse`: Applies the generated palette to stream `s1`.
- `-loop 0`: Makes the GIF loop indefinitely.
- `"${2:-${i%.*}.gif}"`: Output file is either the second command line argument,
  or the input file renamed to `.gif`.

We can now call our `gif` command like this to convert our video to a GIF!

```bash showLineNumbers
gif input.mp4 output.gif
```
