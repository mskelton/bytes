title: Delete Merged Git Branches
tags: [git, productivity]

Keeping your Git branches clean in your local repo is very helpful to make it
easy to switch between branches you are currently working on. The last thing you
want is a bunch of old branches that have already been merged showing in your
list of branches when running `git checkout`.

To solve this problem, I created a simple shell script that will run the
following steps:

1. Checkout the default branch (e.g., `main`)
1. Pull the latest changes
1. Delete local branches that have been deleted on the remote

```bash {10-14}
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -euo pipefail

git checkout $(basename $(git symbolic-ref --short refs/remotes/origin/HEAD))
git pull
git fetch -p

# Delete local branches that have been deleted on remote
git branch -vv |
	grep 'origin/.*: gone]' |
	grep -v '^+' |
	awk '{print $1}' |
	xargs git branch -D
```
