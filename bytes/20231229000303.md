title: Building A Minimal IOC Container
tags: [javascript]

I recently published a new library that is an extremely minimal dependency
injection library: [TiDI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tidi). It has an
intentionally small feature set and is designed specifically for class-based
dependency injection

Below is a simple example showing how to use TiDI (pronounced "tie dye"):

```ts showLineNumbers
import { Container, inject, injectable } from "tidi"

@injectable("userService")
class LoggingService {}

@injectable("userService")
class UserService {
  @inject("loggingService") private loggingService: LoggingService
}

const container = new Container()
container.bind(LoggingService, UserService)
container.get<UserService>("userService")
```

It also supports constructor injection which is useful when you need to access
injected services in the constructor.

```ts showLineNumbers
@injectable("userService")
class UserService {
  constructor(
    @inject("loggingService") private loggingService: LoggingService,
  ) {
    this.loggingService.log("In the constructor!")
  }
}
```

Let me know if you find TiDI useful!
