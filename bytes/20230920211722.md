title: Better z-indexing Using Isolation
tags: [css]
---

Managing z-indexing can be a real pain at times. Dealing with many different
elements, all of which have to specify different z-index values to ensure the
correct stacking context. Thankfully, the CSS `isolation` property can help
remove some of the hassle.

When the `isolation` property is set to `isolate`, it will create a new
[stacking context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Stacking_context)
for the element which it is applied to. This is useful to "isolate" the
`z-index` values of an element's children so you are free to use any `z-index`
values without causing those children to "escape" the element.

```css showLineNumbers {6}
.grandparent {
  z-index: 20;
}

.parent {
  isolation: isolate;
}

.child {
  /* This will not overlap .grandparent, even though it's z-index is higher */
  z-index: 100;
}
```

I really hope to write a full blog post about `z-index` and stacking context
since it's so difficult to explain in just a few short sentences. Until then,
read up on stacking contexts, `z-index`, and `isolation` and you'll thank
yourself for doing so!
