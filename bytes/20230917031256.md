title: Vim Scratch Buffers
tags: vim

I use scratch (unnamed) buffers in Vim a fair bit when working with text
manipulation for content not saved to a file such as editing some JSON, or
building some commands to run from a list of ids. Knowing how to easily create
scratch buffers is a must have when using Vim.

The simplest command for creating a scratch buffer is:

```vim
:enew
```

This will create a new scratch buffer that you can start using. This is akin to
a new unnamed tab in other editors like VS Code. But you can also use the
variants of this command to create a vertical or horizontally split scratch
buffer.

This is very handy since often I want to work in the scratch buffer while
keeping some other code in view.

```vim
:vnew " Scratch buffer in a vertical split
:hnew " Scratch buffer in a horizontal split
```

I originally tried `:vsplit enew` but that creates a vertical split with a
buffer named `enew`, rather than a true scratch buffer. Now I can check this off
my learning list!
