title: Preview npm Package Contents
tags: []

Did you know that you can view the contents of an npm package directly on
[npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com)? Well, you can!

While still marked as a beta feature, this is a great way to preview the
contents of an npm package before you download it, or if you are curious about
the internals of a package, this is a great way to get acquainted with how the
package works.

Now obviously viewing the source code on GitHub is a much better experience, but
sometimes this is not easy due to the repository not being listed in the
package, or as is often the case with some less common React packages (e.g.
`server-only`), the repository where it says it lives, isn't it's true home.
Also, looking at the files published to npm will show exactly what is in the
package itself after all the build steps that a package might have.
