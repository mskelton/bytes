title: Preview npm Package Contents
tags: []

Did you know that you can view the contents of an npm package directly on
[npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com)? Well, you can!

While still marked as a beta feature, this is a great way to preview the
contents of an npm package before you download it, or if you are curious
about the internals of a package, this is a great way to get acquainted
with how the package works.

Now obviously viewing the source code on GitHub is a much better
experience, but sometimes this is not easy due to the repository not being
listed in the package, or as is often the case with some less common React
packages (e.g. `server-only`), the repository where it says it lives, isn't
it's true home. Also, looking at the files published to npm will show
exactly what is in the package itself after all the build steps that a
package might have.
