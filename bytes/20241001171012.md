title: Create a GitHub PR From Your Shell
tags: [bash]
---

I frequently create new GitHub PRs and when contributing to projects I
don't often use, especially open source projects, I like to create them
using the web to make sure I fill out the PR template properly. Sadly,
`gh pr create -w` just doesn't have the
[right defaults](https://github.com/cli/cli/issues/1718), so I turned a
different way...

Basically this script is the combination of many other small Bytes I've
created which all contribute to making this pretty simple:

- [`git default`](https://mskelton.dev/bytes/20241001170913)
- [`remote-url`](https://mskelton.dev/bytes/20240814075601)
- [`url-encode`](https://mskelton.dev/bytes/20240910202811)

With these three commands in place, we can create the following script
which I named `prc` (**PR** **C**reate).

```bash
#!/bin/bash

default_branch=$(git default)
branch=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)

if [[ $branch == "$default_branch" ]]; then
	echo "error: Cannot create a PR from the default branch"
	exit 1
fi

git push
open "$(remote-url)/compare/$default_branch...$(echo "$branch" | url-encode)?body=&expand=1"
```
