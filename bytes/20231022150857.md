title: Open Browser Bookmarks from the Terminal
tags: [cli]
---

Ever wanted to open your browser bookmarks from the terminal? Maybe not, but if
you have a lot of bookmarks and you also happen to spend a lot of time in the
terminal, this can be a great way to quickly launch your bookmarks straight from
the terminal.

The bash script for doing this is actually fairly beefy, but I've broken into
two parts:

1. A script that parses browser bookmarks into a normalized JSON format.
1. A script that takes the normalized bookmarks and manages the fuzzy-finding
   and opening of URLs.

The main reason for splitting the script into these two parts is so that it can
support multiple browsers. All it takes to support a different browser is to
create a shell script for that browser that parses into the normalized
structure, then plug that into the main script and viola.

## Normalizing Chrome bookmarks

Let's get started with the script to normalize the Chrome bookmarks into a
structure that our main script can read. We are using
[`jq`](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) extensively in this entire process
including most importantly parsing the Chrome bookmarks.

I won't explain every detail, but in essence we are collapsing the recursive
nature of Chrome bookmarks into a flat list and creating a slug for each entry
(e.g. "My bookmark" becomes "my-bookmark").

```bash showLineNumbers /usr/local/bin/chrome-bookmarks
#!/usr/bin/env bash

path="$HOME/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Bookmarks"

jq '.roots
  | to_entries[].value
  | recurse(.children[]?)
  | select(.type == "url")
  | {
      name,
      url,
      slug: .name
        | gsub("'\''"; "")
        | gsub("[^a-zA-Z0-9]"; "-")
        | gsub("-{2,}"; "-")
        | gsub("(^-|-$)"; "")
        | ascii_downcase
    }
  ' "$path"
```

## The main script

Now that we have the script to read and normalize our Chrome bookmarks, we can
create our main script to fuzzy-find and open our bookmarks. If called with an
argument, the script will filter the results based on which results start with
the given string and either open [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) if
there are multiple results, or open the bookmark if it is an exact match.

```bash showLineNumbers /usr/local/bin/bm
#!/usr/bin/env bash

list_bookmarks() {
	chrome-bookmarks
}

filter_bookmarks() {
	jq -c --arg key "$1" --arg value "$2" 'select(.[$key] | startswith($value))'
}

find_bookmark() {
	jq -c --arg key "$1" --arg value "$2" 'select(.[$key] == $value)'
}

# If bm is called without argument, show all bookmarks
slug=${1:-}

# Print raw JSON when requested for completions
if [[ "$slug" == '--json' ]]; then
	list_bookmarks | jq -cM
	exit 0
fi

# Filter the bookmarks by the provided slug
bookmarks=$(list_bookmarks | filter_bookmarks 'slug' "$slug")

# If no bookmarks matched the query, exit early
if [[ -z "$bookmarks" ]]; then
	echo 'No bookmark found matching the provided slug'
	exit 1
fi

# If the slug matches an item exactly, open it without prompting to choose other
# options.
match=$(echo "$bookmarks" | find_bookmark 'slug' "$slug")
if [[ -n "$match" ]]; then
	echo "$match" | jq '.url' | xargs open
	exit 0
fi

# Get the exact name of the bookmark
name=$(echo -e "$bookmarks" | jq -r '.name' | fzf --no-info)

# Find the bookmark by name and open the URL in Chrome. If no bookmark is
# selected from the list, exit with an error.
if [[ -n "$name" ]]; then
	echo "$bookmarks" | find_bookmark 'name' "$name" | jq '.url' | xargs open
else
	exit 1
fi
```

Here are some examples of how we might call our script in our terminal:

```bash showLineNumbers
bm
bm my-bookmark
```

## Support for other browsers

As I mentioned, supporting other browsers is fairly trivial, one simply needs to
create a shell script for the desired browser. I've created a version for the
Arc browser which you can view in my
[dotfiles](https://github.com/mskelton/dotfiles/blob/main/bin/arc-bookmarks).

## Shell completions

The script is setup in a way that makes shell completions very simple to add.
Simply add the `--json` flag along with `jq` to format the results in a way that
works for your shell's completion mechanism.

Here is an example for the Fish shell:

```fish showLineNumbers ~/.config/fish/completions/bm.fish
function __bm_complete_bookmarks
    bm --json | jq -r '.slug'
end

complete -c bm -f -n __fish_use_subcommand -a '(__bm_complete_bookmarks)'
```
