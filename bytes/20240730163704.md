title: Multi-Account SSH Authentication for Git
tags: [git]
---

One challenge I ran into recently after starting a new role at
[Ramp](https://ramp.com) was managing SSH authentication multiple GitHub
accounts. Being able to access personal repositories like my
[dotfiles](https://github.com/mskelton/dotfiles) while also accessing work
repositories which are managed by a separate GitHub enterprise account was
something I hadn't done before.

With a very simple trick, I was able to configure my SSH to work seamlessly
for work and personal repositories with very little hassle. To start, I
updated my SSH config like so, splitting into the main `github.com` host
for personal/open-source repositories, and then a `work` host for work
repositories.

```bash ~/.ssh/config
Host github.com
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_personal.pub
  IdentitiesOnly yes

Host work
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_work.pub
  IdentitiesOnly yes
```

You might think, "doesn't the host need to match `github.com`?", but
actually it doesn't! The `Host` property simply defines how to resolve a
given host you have configured as a Git remote. The `HostName`
configuration is where we point to `github.com` as the actual hostname we
are connecting to.

With this in place, we can now clone personal repositories normally:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mskelton/dotfiles.git
```

For work repositories, it's almost exactly the same as normal, but instead
of specifying `git@github.com:` we can simply specify `work:` and then the
repository path. Neat right!

```bash
git clone work:ramp/repo.git
```
